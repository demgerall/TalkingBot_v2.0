<h1>TalkingBot_v2.0</h1>
<p>This is our research project in which we are creating a bot for a computer that uses voice control and can execute various commands. In this update, we want to improve the operation of the program by adding recognition of the starting phrase, add improved voice recognition using the Vosk library, as well as introduce artificial intelligence ChatGPT, as well as AI for speech synthesis so that it looks like a human one.</p>
